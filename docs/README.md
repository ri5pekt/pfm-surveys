## 🏗️ Architecture Documents

### Coming Soon

The following documents will be added as the architecture is implemented:

-   **architecture.md** - Detailed system architecture including:

    -   Component diagram
    -   Data flow diagrams
    -   Database schema
    -   API endpoint specifications
    -   Queue architecture
    -   Security model

-   **decisions.md** - Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) documenting:
    -   Why Node.js + Fastify
    -   Why Kysely over an ORM
    -   Why BullMQ for job processing
    -   Why client-side identity in Phase 1
    -   Why rollups over real-time aggregation
    -   And other key technical decisions

## 🔧 Technical Stack Reference

### Backend

-   **Runtime:** Node.js 20+
-   **Framework:** Fastify
-   **Language:** TypeScript
-   **Database:** PostgreSQL
-   **Query Builder:** Kysely
-   **Jobs:** Redis + BullMQ
-   **Auth:** JWT (access + refresh tokens)

### Frontend (Admin Dashboard)

-   **Framework:** Vue 3
-   **Build Tool:** Vite
-   **State Management:** Pinia
-   **UI Library:** PrimeVue (Aura theme)
-   **Language:** TypeScript
-   **Routing:** Vue Router

### Embed Widget

-   **Language:** Vanilla JavaScript
-   **Build Tool:** Vite (library mode)
-   **Delivery:** Async loader + versioned bundle

### Infrastructure

-   **Containers:** Docker + Docker Compose
-   **Reverse Proxy:** Caddy
-   **Deployment:** Single VPS

## 📊 Data Model Overview

### Core Entities

-   **Tenants** - Top-level organization
-   **Sites** - Websites where surveys are embedded
-   **Surveys** - Survey configurations and questions
-   **Events** - Raw impression and interaction events (append-only)
-   **Answers** - User responses to survey questions
-   **Rollups** - Pre-aggregated daily statistics (disposable)

### Design Principles

-   Raw events are immutable (append-only)
-   Rollups are derived and disposable
-   Watermark-based incremental aggregation
-   No synchronous analytics during ingestion

## 🔐 Security Model

-   **Embed Security:** HMAC-signed requests with timestamp validation and nonce replay prevention
-   **Admin Auth:** JWT access tokens (15min) + refresh tokens (7 days)
-   **Multi-tenancy:** Complete data isolation per tenant
-   **Input Validation:** All external input treated as hostile

## 🚀 Development Workflow

**Hybrid Development Setup:**

-   Infrastructure (PostgreSQL, Redis) in Docker containers
-   Application code (API, Worker, Admin) runs locally for fast iteration

```bash
# Environment setup
cp .env.example .env

# Start infrastructure only (PostgreSQL + Redis in Docker)
docker-compose up -d

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run migrations
pnpm --filter api migrate:latest

# Start dev servers (locally, not in Docker)
pnpm dev
```

**Services:**

-   🐳 PostgreSQL: `localhost:5432` (Docker)
-   🐳 Redis: `localhost:6379` (Docker)
-   💻 API: `http://localhost:3000` (local Node.js)
-   💻 Worker: background process (local Node.js)
-   💻 Admin: `http://localhost:5173` (local Vite with HMR)

See [Quick Start Cheat Sheet](./QUICK_START.md) for all commands.
